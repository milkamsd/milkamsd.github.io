        Future Career Goals</h1>
        <p>My name is milka mulugeta. I am a student at EiABC College completing first year fresh man course . My educational aspirations consist of acquiring a bachelorâ€™s degree in architecture  . On the other hand, my career vision is to one day be able to provide affordable designs to marginalized communities in Ethiopia. However, I am certain that if I do not complete my college degree I could never have the opportunity to achieve my career goals.</p>

          <p>I decided that I will attain a career as a architecture since my passion has always been assisting others and trying to improve their quality of life.Therefore, I think that pursuing such a career will provide me the opportunity to help improve the community's quality conditions and learn about their environment.</p>
    <p>I know that all of my goals will remain dreams if I do not complete my medical degree. Therefore, I am committed to working hard in school and looking for opportunities that could help me make my goals a reality.</p>
